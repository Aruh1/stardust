# Before Opening an Issue - Warning

Before opening an issue, please read and consider the following points:

1. **Check if it's a codebase/source error**: Ensure that the issue you're facing is related to the codebase or source. If it's not, make sure you're sending the relevant error information. Please note that you should not send any error logs about the source error before the successful installation (`npm i`). Example:

2. **Verify successful installation (`npm i`)**: Ensure that you have successfully installed the necessary dependencies using `npm i`. Here's an example of a successful installation message:

3. **Contributors suggestion**: Before reporting that something is not working, consider trying the following:

    - **Review the contributors' guidelines**: Check if there are any specific guidelines or instructions provided for contributors. Follow them accordingly.

    - **Consider old code/packages**: Keep in mind that not all old code or packages are better. Some may be vulnerable or unrelated to the project. Evaluate their relevance before suggesting the use of older code or packages.

Remember, opening an issue should be reserved for genuine codebase/source errors or related concerns. Thank you for your cooperation!
